    "title": "Prerequisites",
    "section": "The pipe",
    "text": "The pipe\nWhen coding I make use of what is called the pipe operator (notice that you can only use this when you loaded the tidyverse package).\nThe pipe in R code is the following: %&gt;%\nWhat is nice about using the pipe operator is that you can read a piece of code from left to right focussing on the verbs (as Hadley Wickham will call it sometimes).\nA short example.\nImagine you have a vector of numbers for which you want to calculate a mean: c(1,2,3,4,5).\nThere are different ways to do this in R.\nA first one is doing it in separate lines of code:\n\nx &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nFor this easy example this would work fine. But a typical side-effect of working this way is that we create a lot of objects along the way. Here we created the object x that stored the values of the vector.\nTo avoid this we could combine all the code in one line by embedding functions:\n\nmean(c(1,2,3,4,5))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOne line of code and no storage of a new object. But this can get complicated if you want to combine a set of functions resulting in almost non-readable code!\nThen there is the pipe operator:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nc(1,2,3,4,5) %&gt;%\n  mean()\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThis is how to read this code:\n\nc(1,2,3,4,5) %&gt;% # create the vector and then\n  mean()         # calculate the mean\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nSo the pipe can be read as take (or create) A and then do B with the result. We could create a whole pipeline of functions to be applied in this way making use of the pipe operator (this becomes more clear in the next section when we shortly describe the dplyr verbs).\nA tweet that I encountered gives a great analogy. Using the pipe you could write:\n\nI %&gt;% woke up %&gt;% took a shower %&gt;% got breakfast %&gt;% took the metro %&gt;% arrived at work %&gt;% …\n\nIn a recent update of R they also introduced this idea of a pipe as a “native pipe”. This is written as |&gt; and functions in a similar way as %&gt;% with the advantage that it will also work outside the tidyverse. I’m slowly transforming all my material and code to make use of this native pipe. But as I am notoriously sloppy, the chances are high that you will encounter some old-fashioned tidyverse pipes in my code during the workshop…\n\nI |&gt; learned about the native pipe |&gt; transformed my code |&gt; potentially failed somewhere …",

    "section": "dplyr verbs",
    "text": "dplyr verbs\nWithin the tidyverse universe we can make use of a great package called dplyr for a broad spectrum of data-management functions. The functions provided in that package are also sometimes called verbs:\n\nmutate( ) to do recoding etc;\nselect( ) to select a subset of columns/variables;\nfilter( ) to filter cases;\ngroup_by( ) to apply what’s coming afterwards for specific groups in the data by a grouping variable;\narrange( ) to sort the data;\nsummarize( ) to apply summarizing functions (like taking the mean etc.);\nrename( ) to rename columns;\n\nThese functions can be combined in a single statement making use of the pipe operator.\nHere are some examples on the use of these verbs applied to the built-in dataset starwars that is part of the tidyverse package.\nCalculate the mean birth_year for all the characters:\n\nstarwars |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    mean_birth_year = mean(birth_year, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) |&gt;\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_birth_year\n            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            87.6\n\n\nCalculate the average height and the average mass by gender:\n\nstarwars |&gt;\n  group_by(gender) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = T),\n    mean_mass = mean(mass, na.rm = T)\n  ) \n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  gender    mean_height mean_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 feminine         167.      54.7\n2 masculine        177.     107. \n3 &lt;NA&gt;             175       81  \n\n\nNow, let’s use the verbs to create a graph. We want to create a scatterplot with mass on the x-axis and height on the y-axis. Also, we want to add a third variable in the mix: whether the character’s birth year is hither than 50 or not (just for fun). Finally, we only want to show characters that have a mass lower than 200 and with a birth_year that is known.\n\nstarwars |&gt;\n  # First filter the cases with a mass higher than 200 and for which birth_year is not NA\n  filter(\n    mass &lt; 200,\n    !is.na(birth_year)\n  ) |&gt;\n\n  # Then we create a variable that has value yes if the character's birth year is above 50 and no otherwise\n  mutate(\n    birth_above_50 = if_else(birth_year &gt; 50, \"yes\", \"no\") \n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  # Select the necessary variables for the graph (not really necessary but this is to show this option)\n  select(\n    height, \n    mass, \n    birth_above_50) |&gt;\n\n  # Create the graph\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = mass, y = height, color = birth_above_50)\n  ) + geom_point()",
