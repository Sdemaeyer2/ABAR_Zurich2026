Here you can find two books that I would suggest for learning more about Bayesian analyses.\n\nA first book is the book by <b>Ben Lambert</b>: <b>\"A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics\"</b>. This book is great if you want to learn more about the statistical theory behind Bayesian analyses and MCMC sampling. He succeeds in explaining these topics in a thorough conceptual way, without you getting lost in the mathematics and formulas. For me, this book was of great value!\n\nA big hit these days is the book by <b> Richard McElreath</b>: <b>\"Statistical Rethinking. A Bayesian Course with examples in R and Stan\" </b>. In this course, Richard McElreath introduces statistical reasoning from scratch, integrating three key components for good statistical thinking: DAGs, Bayesian statistics, and multi-level models. So, this book is more than solely a book about Bayesian models. The lectures of Richard McElreath based on this book can be found for free on YouTube. \n\n## Some free online books `r fontawesome::fa(\"book\")`\n\n-   John Kruschke's book <b>Doing Bayesian Data Analyses: a tutorial with R, Jags, and Stan </b>:\n\n<a href=\"https://nyu-cdsc.github.io/learningr/assets/kruschke_bayesian_in_R.pdf\" target=\"blank\">https://nyu-cdsc.github.io/learningr/assets/kruschke_bayesian_in_R.pdf</a>\n\n-   Bayes Rules!:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/\" target=\"blank\">https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/</a>\n\n-   Or this book:\n\n<a href=\"https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/\"> https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/ </a>\n\n\n\n## THE Podcast `r fontawesome::fa(\"podcast\")`\n\nIf you like running - like I do - this could be a great companion on your run!
